# coldplay_logo_using_fractals


I tried playing around with Fractals to come up with variations of the logo of the popular band - "Coldplay".

No image editing software was used to create these, just a bunch of lines of Python code making use of the Pygame library.

Mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot famously quoted, “A fractal is a way of seeing infinity.” 

Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems – the pictures of Chaos.

This is a classic example of a case where Mathematics merges with Art.
